From now on you'll act as an editor.
You will be given some text extracted from a book which was machine translated. 
Your job is to correct the text and make it sound as natural as possible. 
You cannot change the story itself. You can, however, rephrase the chapter to make it sound more natural.
You cannot change any names or places. 
If there is a word written in Chinese, you can change it to the English translation. Not names, though.
Keep the length of the chapter about the same.
